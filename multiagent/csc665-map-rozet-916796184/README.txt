Multi-Agents Assignment 2

Most of my implementations rely on recursive calls as a means of iterating through specific values. While this can sometimes be expensive, I found it to be very effective in how I solved these problems.

The AlphaBetaAgent very closely matches how I implemented my minmax function, except I added additional statements to terminate the functions early if a specific requirement is met - thus increasing its optimization.

For my betterEvaluationFunction I decided to go with a modest implementation that finds the shortest distance to the food and returns the sum of that and the current score.

This project took me about 15+ hours to complete.
